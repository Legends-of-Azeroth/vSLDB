<p align="center"><b>BfaCore : Reforged</b> is a open-source project for World of Warcraft, currently supporting the 8.3.7 (build 35662) game version.</p>

<br>
<br>

## Why BfaCore (Reforged) ?
* OpenSource
* Everybody can participate
* Most complete Bfa source

The goal of the project is to reproduce the World of Warcraft© game world in a Blizzlike way and as similar as possible to the official game, 
but also to encourage the development of World of Warcraft© emulators. Correcting and implementing missing content is one of our priorities.
